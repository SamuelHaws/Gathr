# Gathr

This is a web application I developed (and sometimes add to) in Angular. Its primary purpose was to reinforce concepts I had learned following online courses / tutorials on the Angular framework.

Learning web development has been a really fun process for me, and I'm excited to be able to present another complete web application that provides legitimate functionality with a clean, pleasant UI/UX to match (my first web application being [Bujit](https://github.com/SamuelHaws/Bujit), a lightweight budgeting app written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS). I can say after "completion" of this application that I am very much a fan of the Angular framework. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2. As an MVP of sorts, the backend is provided by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), Google's premier BaaS. The logo was designed by [ei8htz](https://www.fiverr.com/ei8htz).

If you happen to spot bugs or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to submit an issue or pull request.

Thanks!
